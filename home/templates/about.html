      <p>making Peoples Lives Easier</p>

      <p>Hi, my name is Michael Williams. I am a newer developer with a strong desire and ability to learn. My background is in web development, consulting, advising, and counseling. When I am not coding, I enjoy volunteering, exercising, and traveling. I want to help organizations use technology to solve real business problems. After living abroad, I have found my new home in the Pacific Northwest. Relocated earlier this year to Portland, Oregon.</p>
